# drone_dashboard
his project is a **real-time drone control dashboard** built with **Python**, **CustomTkinter**, and **MAVSDK**.  
It provides a modern, Apple-style dark interface to monitor and control MAVLink-based drones such as PX4 or ArduPilot.

The system allows you to **connect**, **arm**, **take off**, **land**, and manually control **throttle**, **yaw**, **pitch**, and **roll**, while displaying live telemetry ‚Äî GPS position, altitude, attitude, and battery level ‚Äî in real time.  
An elegant attitude indicator visualizes roll and pitch dynamically, and a **mock test mode** is included for running the full interface without a real drone connected.

The architecture cleanly separates GUI (`dashboard.py`) and drone logic (`drone_controller.py`), combining **asyncio** concurrency with **CustomTkinter‚Äôs** smooth interface for fast, stable performance.  
It‚Äôs designed for **robotics, UAV research**, and **Teknofest-style competitions**, making it an excellent base for advanced drone projects or autonomous flight experimentation.
